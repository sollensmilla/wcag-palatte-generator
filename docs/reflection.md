# Clean Code reflections- Smilla Sollén

## Chapter 2


## Chapter 3


## Chapter 4
This chapter made me reflect on how cluttered my old code with heaps of JSDocs looked. I appreciated the principle that. **comments do not make up for bad code** and that code should **explain itself**, using comments only as a last resort. I learned a lot from the section on **redundant** comments and **mandated** comments, realizing that over-documentation often just clutters the code and makes it harder to read. While I didn’t find reasons to include legal comments or other types of good comments, I chose to keep the JSDoc header `/** WCAG Color Service ... */` in the public API class and controllers, since these are the classes users interact with most, and including author and version feels valuable and clear. Overall, I now try to balance **self-explanatory code** with minimal, purposeful commenting, only where it adds real clarity.
